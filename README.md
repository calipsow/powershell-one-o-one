Personal Recommendation is installing [Powershell 7.4](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows?view=powershell-7.4) it brings a lot of handy extras.

```powershell
# Search for the latest pwsh version
winget search Microsoft.PowerShell
```

_Output_:
